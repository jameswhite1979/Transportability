*Generates a weight variable wt that is used in the subsequent weighted regression. The formula calculates the weight as the inverse of the product of the predicted probabilities of membership of the trial (assist=1) and target population (SDDU=0) groups.*
gen wt=((1-ps)/(ps))*(num/(1-num))


*Sets the weight variable wt to 0 for observations where study=0, effectively removing them from the regression analysis. This is because the analysis focuses on estimating the effect of the intervention in the trial population which is study=1.*
